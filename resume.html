                            <li>Created a chatbot with Streamlit as the frontend and Python as the backend that created, stored, and pulled up conversations (with context) with each individual that chatted with it.</li>
                            <li>User chats were recalled using a voice recognition system that asks users to first enter their name, then say a password for the chatbot to hear how the user sounds and link the password and voice data to the user's name.</li>
                            <li>Voice data was stored by first converting each individual voice to an embedding and then storing that data within a vector database. When someone speaks to the chatbot, their voice is ran against the vector database to see if their voice exists within its database. If the user's voice existed, then the chatbot would pull up the conversation it previously had with the user and continue where it left off. If the voice was not recognized, then a new embedding would be created and stored.</li>
