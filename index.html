                    <p>Hi! My name is Matthew Le, and I am a <strong>3rd year CS major</strong> from San Luis Obispo. One fun fact about me is that I played the piano for 5 years. In my free time, 
                        I enjoy doing physical activities such as playing basketball, pickleball, running, and hiking, but I also enjoy playing video games and watching anime.</p>
                    <p>This year, I want to join Hack4Impact because I want to be able to gain experience in a team-coding environment, develope my coding abilities, and have a 
                        positive impact on the community that I grew up in by getting an opportunity to code for a non-profit in SLO.</p>
